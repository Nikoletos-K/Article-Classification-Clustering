# WordClouds - Classification - Clustering |  Project 2
---
__Language:__ python > 3.0

__Data:__ Articles from five different sections (business,entertainment, politics, sport, tech) of an news site.

This project consists of __2 main queries.__ 

## 1st Query | WordCloud creation
Given the text from the articles,I am making a text-clean and after some wordclouds for each category.Most common words can be now deppicted.

## 2nd Query | Classification 
Working with,
Classifiers: __Support Vector Machines (with GridSearchCV),Random Forests,Naive Bayes,K-Nearest Neighbor
__*KNN implementation included*__

We are using 10-fold Cross Validation and scores: Precision / Recall / F-Measure / Accuracy . Also depicting classifivation using ROC-plots

## 3rd Query | Beat the Benchmark
Optimizing the q.2 scores.

## 4th Query | Clustering

- For the clustering we use K-Means (numver of clusters=5)
- Pre-trained embeddings  (word2vec, glove,fast-text).
- Compressing the data to 2d with PCA,ICA,SVD
